To add OpenGL libraries to the project path:
Just go to project properties -> Configuration properties -> Linker.
Goto to ->General and set the "Additional Library directories" to point to:
C:\smd\git\cs551\Opengl\lib

Then goto to Linker -> Input and type in ;GLAUX.LIB;GLU32.LIB;glut32.lib;OPENGL32.LIB 
in the "Additional Dependencies" field

#Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> 
#  C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories = C:\smd\git\cs551\Opengl\include

Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> 
  C/C++ -> Command Line -> Command Line additional options = /D _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS

Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Environment = PATH=C:\smd\git\cs551\Opengl\lib;%PATH%
